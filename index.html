								<h2>About Us<br />
								</h2>
								<p> Lynbrook Challenge Success is a high school branch of Stanford’s Challenge Success team and operates as a student team working alongside PTSA to help reduce the high levels of stress on campus through creative activities and speakers. Our purpose is to bring awareness to students that a 4.0 GPA, 2400 SAT score, and 15 APs doesn’t measure one’s ability and happiness. “Success is measured through the course of a lifetime, not at the end of a semester.” Scroll down to read about our past events!

								<h2>Challenge Success Fishbowl<br />
							     </h2>
								<p>A panel consisting of students in different grades and active in different extracurriculars was held in a form of Q + A fishbowl session. They were asked about their thoughts on school, homework, extracurriculars, expectations, pressures, and more. Parents were invited to gain an unshrouded understanding into the lives of their children. You can read the responses here: <a href = "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PIdl7EGtUHgVTiCMsZPMU7wi0TggLTs_aia22-wYxC4/edit?usp=sharing">Challenge Success Fishbowl Trancript</a></p>

							    </h2>

								<h2>Wednesday - Bouncy Houses<br />
								</h2>
                                <p>Challenge Success brought in two bouncy activities: a bouncehouse and an obstacle course! Students could participate in both! For those that were not competitive, students jumped freely on their own in the bouncehouse. Other students raced their friends through the obstacle course! Many could be seen laughing their way across as they fell over themselves and got back up to finally crawl to the finish!</p>
